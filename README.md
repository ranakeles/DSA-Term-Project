## Project Overview
In this project, I will analyze data from the TMDB Movies dataset and the Global Inflation dataset to see how global inflation rates affect movie revenues and popular genres.

## Data Collection Plan
- **Step 1:** Download both datasets from their sources.
- **Step 2:** Load the data into Python using Pandas to analyze it.
- **Step 3:** Clean and prepare the data by fixing missing values and making sure the data types are correct.
- **Step 4:** Combine the datasets by matching the time periods to compare the data.
